Queremos Saber (We want to know)
================================

Part of QueremosSaber.org.br, a brazilian freedom of information portal.

This extension takes care of overlaying of templates and resources without 
the need to touch the core Alaveteli software.

To install::
 
  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/okfn/queremossaber.git

Look in the lib/ folder of the plugin to see how the overrides happen.

Note that the `install.rb` plugin point sets up a symlink to include
local resource files within the Rails `public/` directory.
